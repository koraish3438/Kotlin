# Kolin ðŸš€

This repository is my personal journey of learning **Kotlin** step by step.  
I will regularly practice and upload files based on each topic I learn.

---

## ðŸ“š Learning Plan
I will follow a step-by-step approach to learn Kotlin:
1. Basics of Kotlin (variables, data types, operators)
2. Control Flow (if-else, when, loops)
3. Functions and Scope
4. Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
5. Collections & Generics
6. Exception Handling
7. Kotlin for Android (later stage)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Each topic I learn will have a separate folder or file, for example:

kolin/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01_basics/
â”œâ”€â”€ 02_control_flow/
â”œâ”€â”€ 03_functions/
â”œâ”€â”€ 04_oop/
â”œâ”€â”€ 05_collections/
